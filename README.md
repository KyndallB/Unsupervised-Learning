# Myopia Clusters

## Context
The data science team of a medical research company is interested in finding better ways to predict myopia, or nearsightedness; the team has tried—and failed—to improve their classification model when training on the whole dataset. However, they believe that there might be distinct groups of patients that would be better to analyze separately. So, the supervisor has asked to explore this possibility by using unsupervised learning.

Using raw data, process it to fit the machine learning models. Use several clustering algorithms to explore whether the patients can be placed into distinct groups. Then, create a visualization to share your findings with your team and other key stakeholders.

## Instructions

1. Prepare the data.

2. Add dimensionality reduction.

3. Perform a cluster analysis with k-means.

4. Make a reccomendation.
